# 1. Define a complex variable z as z = -1 - 2j
z = complex('-1 - 2j')

# 2. Find the real and imaginary part of z.


# 3. Determine the magnitude of z using both ABS and
#    the formula involving R and Im. parts of z. Equal?


# 4. Determine phase of z using both arctan and ANGLE function.


# 5. Calculate (z + z*) / 2 and (z - z*) / 2j
